Homework 3 Reflection:

	  This assignment was a little trickier than I expected it to be, but not too bad once I got over my initial problem. That problem being figuring out how to turn the test data I had into test scores. I had a plan for what I needed to do in theory, but the execution of said plan ended up stumping me for a little bit, since I wasn’t super familiar with pandas yet. 
	  Once I worked out how to do what I needed to do, though, it was lot more smooth sailing. I’m sort of happy with the end result? I think I could’ve done better when it came to actually analyzing the data, but I was low on time and needed to catch up on other stuff. If I could do anything different, I would figure out how to effectively incorporate graphs somehow.
	  I have to say data analysis probably isn’t my thing, but this was an interesting project nonetheless. Working with pandas was cool and it’s probably good that I’m more familiar with it now, in case I need to work with it again in the future. Also, I really enjoyed using Jupyter notebook, it’s a very useful application.
